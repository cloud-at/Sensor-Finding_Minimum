# Sensor-Finding_Minimum

This Programm is my first attempt on coding in python and programming in general. It's meant to read data via a serial connection 
from an oxygen sensor, split the data according to the structure of the string and search for local minima within a certain range. 
Raw values of the oxygen concentration and the minima found within are written to seperate files.

- requires Python 3.6
